# Sudoku Guru

## Purpose

I've always loved solving sudoku puzzles in my times of boredom, why not go a step further and build something to solve them for me.

_inspired by [@ASpittel](https://github.com/aspittel/)'s article on Dev.to: [Coming Back to Old Problems: How I Finally Wrote a Sudoku Solving Algorithm](https://dev.to/aspittel/how-i-finally-wrote-a-sudoku-solver-177g) which convinced me to try and right my own._

## Code Style

Run it through Prettier, you know the drill.
